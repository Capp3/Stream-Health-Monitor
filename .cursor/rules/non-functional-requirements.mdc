# Stream Health Monitor: Non-Functional Requirements

Key NFRs to consider during development:

- **Scalability:** Design to monitor initial targets (4 feeds, 1 network) but allow flexibility for future expansion (FOSS goal).
- **Performance:** Aim for low latency monitoring. Polling frequencies should be configurable.
- **Reliability:** Ensure high availability. Monitoring system failures should be self-reported.
- **Maintainability:** Prioritize clear code, use YAML for approachable configuration, and limit the interface to information display.
- **Security:** Isolate sensitive data (e.g., API keys) in `.env` files within the `config/` directory.
