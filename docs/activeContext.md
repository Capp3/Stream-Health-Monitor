# Active Development Context

## Current Focus

We are currently in the planning phase for the Stream Health Monitor project. Our focus is on:

1. Completing the implementation plan and architecture design
2. Preparing for Phase 1 implementation:
   - Project structure setup
   - Database component (Prometheus) implementation
   - Configuration system development

## Implementation Plan Summary

The project will be implemented in four phases:

1. **Phase 1: Project Setup and Foundation**
   - Basic project structure
   - Prometheus database setup
   - Configuration system implementation

2. **Phase 2: Core Monitoring Implementation**
   - Web Presenter monitoring
   - Vimeo API monitoring
   - FFprobe/GStream stream monitoring
   - Network environment monitoring

3. **Phase 3: Alerting and Visualization**
   - Alert system implementation
   - Grafana dashboard creation

4. **Phase 4: Integration and Testing**
   - End-to-end testing
   - Performance optimization

## Key Architectural Decisions

1. **Database Selection**: Prometheus has been selected as the primary time-series database
   - See docs/database_decision.md for detailed analysis
   - Key factors: Pull-based monitoring, Grafana integration, alerting capabilities

2. **Project Structure**: Modular design with separate components
   - See docs/project_structure.md for detailed structure
   - FastAPI for the HTTP API service
   - Separate monitoring modules for different targets
   - Containerized deployment with Docker

3. **Configuration Approach**:
   - YAML files for non-sensitive configuration
   - Environment variables (.env) for sensitive data
   - Centralized configuration management

## Key Requirements

Based on the project brief, the system needs to:

1. Monitor Blackmagic Design Web Presenters via JSON scraping/SNMP
2. Monitor Vimeo Live Streams via their API
3. Monitor generic streams using FFprobe/GStream
4. Monitor local network environment for connectivity and performance
5. Provide alerting capabilities for stream issues
6. Visualize all data through Grafana dashboards

## Technical Considerations

- The system will be implemented in Python 3.12
- Deployment will be via Docker containers
- Configuration will use YAML files with sensitive data in .env files
- Time-series database selection (Prometheus vs InfluxDB) is a key decision point

## Next Steps

1. Begin implementing Phase 1:
   - Create base project structure
   - Set up development environment
   - Configure Docker containers
   - Implement Prometheus integration
   - Develop configuration system

2. Prepare for Phase 2:
   - Research integration approaches for each monitoring target
   - Define detailed metrics schemas
   - Design monitoring workflows
