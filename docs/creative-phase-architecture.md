ðŸŽ¨ðŸŽ¨ðŸŽ¨ ENTERING CREATIVE PHASE: Architecture Design ðŸŽ¨ðŸŽ¨ðŸŽ¨

## Component Description
The core architecture component of the Stream Health Monitor: defines the modular structure, component relationships, data flow patterns, and integration points.

## Requirements & Constraints
- Must support modular, independent monitoring modules for different stream types.
- Must allow straightforward addition of new monitoring modules.
- Must integrate with FastAPI HTTP API service and Prometheus metrics scraping.
- Must support containerized deployment via Docker on Linux.
- Should minimize inter-module dependencies to facilitate isolated testing and deployments.

## Options Analysis

### Option 1: Monolithic Service
**Description**: Bundle all monitoring logic into a single FastAPI application with internal module classes.
**Pros**:
- Simplest deployment (single container).
- Easier to manage in small-scale setups.
**Cons**:
- Hard to scale individual monitoring components.
- Single point of failure for all monitoring.
- Tests and updates may impact unrelated modules.
**Complexity**: Low
**Implementation Time**: Short

### Option 2: Microservices per Module
**Description**: Deploy each monitoring module (Web Presenter, Vimeo, FFprobe, Network) as a separate microservice.
**Pros**:
- Independent scaling and deployment per service.
- Better fault isolation.
- Clear service boundaries and ownership.
**Cons**:
- Higher operational complexity (multiple containers/services).
- Requires service discovery and orchestration.
- More complex CI/CD pipeline.
**Complexity**: High
**Implementation Time**: Long

### Option 3: Modular Monolith
**Description**: Single FastAPI application with each monitoring module implemented in its own sub-package and clear interfaces.
**Pros**:
- Balance between monolith simplicity and modularity.
- Facilitates isolated development and testing of modules.
- Single deployment with clear module separation.
**Cons**:
- Resource contention risk within a single container.
- Less flexible scaling compared to microservices.
**Complexity**: Medium
**Implementation Time**: Medium

## Recommended Approach
Use **Option 3: Modular Monolith**.

**Rationale**:
- Allows clear module boundaries while keeping deployment and operational overhead low.
- Meets initial scale requirements (monitoring 4 feeds) and can evolve to microservices if needed.
- Simplifies configuration and orchestration while supporting isolated testing.

## Implementation Guidelines
- Organize each monitoring module under `src/stream_health_monitor/monitors/` as its own sub-package.
- Use FastAPI routers to group endpoints per module.
- Define a common metrics registration interface for each module to expose Prometheus metrics.
- Leverage dependency injection (`Depends`) to manage module services in the API.
- Build a single Docker image; use entry-point flags or environment variables to enable/disable modules if needed.

## Verification Checkpoint
- Are monitoring modules logically separated under distinct packages? [YES/NO]
- Does each module expose its own `/metrics` endpoint? [YES/NO]
- Can new modules be added without modifying existing code? [YES/NO]
