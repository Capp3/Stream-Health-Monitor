# Project Status

## Current Status

The project is in the planning phase. We've completed:
- Analysis of project requirements from the projectbrief.md
- Creation of comprehensive implementation plan
- Database selection analysis (Prometheus selected as primary database)
- Project structure definition

## Current Focus

- Planning the architecture and component design
- Setting up the core project structure
- Preparing for implementation of Phase 1 tasks:
  - Basic project structure
  - Database component setup
  - Configuration system implementation

## Key Decisions Made

- **Database Selection**: Prometheus will be used as the primary time-series database
  - Rationale documented in docs/database_decision.md
  - Pull-based monitoring aligns well with streaming health checks
  - Excellent integration with Grafana for visualization

- **Project Structure**: Modular design with separate components for different monitoring types
  - Structure documented in docs/project_structure.md
  - Facilitates independent development and testing of monitoring modules

## Blockers

No blockers identified yet.
