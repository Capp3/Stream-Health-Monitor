# Database Selection: Prometheus vs. InfluxDB Analysis

## Overview

This document analyzes the selection between Prometheus and InfluxDB for the Stream Health Monitor project, focusing on their suitability for video stream monitoring use cases.

## Comparison Matrix

| Feature                 | Prometheus                        | InfluxDB                                 |
| ----------------------- | --------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| **Architecture**        | Pull-based (scrapes metrics)      | Push-based (receives metrics)            |
| **Data Model**          | Time-series with key-value labels | Time-series with tags and fields         |
| **Query Language**      | PromQL (powerful for time-series) | Flux/InfluxQL (SQL-like)                 |
| **Retention**           | Configurable, simpler options     | Configurable, more granular control      |
| **Scalability**         | Horizontal with federation        | Clustering (enterprise) or single node   |
| **Grafana Integration** | Native, excellent                 | Good, requires more configuration        |
| **Alerting**            | Built-in AlertManager             | Kapacitor or external tools needed       |
| **High Cardinality**    | Limited handling                  | Better handling of high cardinality data |
| **Write Throughput**    | Limited by scrape interval        | Higher potential throughput              |
| **Storage Efficiency**  | Good compression                  | Very good compression                    |

## Analysis for Stream Health Monitoring

### Use Case Considerations

#### Prometheus Advantages

1. **Native Grafana Integration**
   - Seamless integration with Grafana, which is our visualization platform
   - Excellent dashboard templates available for monitoring systems

2. **Pull-Based Architecture Benefits**
   - Built-in service discovery and health checking
   - Automatic detection of offline services
   - Scrape interval as health check mechanism

3. **Alerting Capabilities**
   - Built-in AlertManager for alert aggregation and routing
   - Rich alert rule configuration options
   - Integration with various notification channels

4. **Service Discovery**
   - Excellent for discovering and monitoring dynamic targets
   - Works well in containerized environments (Docker/Kubernetes)

#### InfluxDB Advantages

1. **Push-Based Architecture Benefits**
   - No need for network accessibility to monitoring targets
   - Better for ephemeral/short-lived metrics sources
   - Potentially lower latency for time-critical alerts

2. **Data Model Flexibility**
   - Better suited for high-cardinality data
   - More flexible field types and metadata storage
   - Good for heterogeneous metrics (different videos with varying properties)

3. **Write Performance**
   - Higher write throughput potential
   - May handle burst scenarios better (e.g., multiple simultaneous stream issues)

4. **Retention and Downsampling**
   - More granular control over data retention policies
   - Continuous queries for automatic downsampling

## Video Stream Monitoring Specific Analysis

### Prometheus Suitability

1. **Stream Availability Monitoring**
   - Pull model naturally detects unavailable streams
   - Built-in up/down state tracking
   - Efficient for basic stream health metrics

2. **Integration with FFprobe Workers**
   - Workers can expose metrics endpoints for Prometheus to scrape
   - Simple to integrate with various data sources

### InfluxDB Suitability

1. **Stream Quality Metrics**
   - Better handling of variable frame rates, resolution changes, etc.
   - Handles high-cardinality data better (many streams with many properties)
   - More flexible for storing heterogeneous stream properties

2. **Historical Analysis**
   - Better for long-term storage and querying of historical data
   - More efficient for storing large amounts of quality metrics

## Recommendation

### Primary Recommendation: Prometheus

For the Stream Health Monitor project, **Prometheus** is recommended as the primary time-series database for the following reasons:

1. **Alignment with Architecture**: The pull-based model works well with our service-based architecture
2. **Grafana Integration**: Seamless integration with our visualization layer
3. **Alerting**: Built-in alerting capabilities that match our requirements
4. **Operational Simplicity**: Easier to set up and operate at our expected scale
5. **Monitoring Needs**: Well-suited for the uptime and health metrics that are our primary concern

### Alternative Approach

If we determine that high-cardinality data or detailed historical analysis becomes more important than initially expected, we could implement a hybrid approach:

1. Use Prometheus for active monitoring, alerting, and current state visualization
2. Add InfluxDB for long-term storage and detailed historical analysis
3. Use Telegraf to forward metrics from Prometheus to InfluxDB

## Implementation Strategy

1. Begin with Prometheus as our primary metrics store
2. Configure appropriate retention periods based on our 5-day history requirement
3. Set up AlertManager for our alerting needs
4. Create Grafana dashboards utilizing Prometheus data sources
5. If needed, revisit the decision to add InfluxDB for specialized use cases
